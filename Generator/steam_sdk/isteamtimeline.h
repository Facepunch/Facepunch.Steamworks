	//  * The current score for a sports game
	//
	// Parameters:

	// - flTimeDelta: The time offset in seconds to apply to this event. Negative times indicate an
	//			event that happened in the past.

	/*******************    Timeline Events    *******************/

	// The following functions add events and/or tags to the timeline.  There are helpers to add simple events or tags in a single call.
	// or you can use StartEvent and CloseEvent to customize what gets added.
	//
	// Examples of events to add could include:
	//   * a boss battle
	//   * a cut scene
	//   * a large team fight
	//   * picking up a new weapon or ammunition
	//   * scoring a goal
	//
	// Adding an event and a time range with the simple API:
	//   SteamTimeline()->AddSimpleTimelineEvent( "steam_heart", Localize( "#user healed" ), Localize( "#health_amount", 27 ), 15, 0, 0, k_ETimelineEventClipPriority_None );
	//   SteamTimeline()->AddTaggedTimeRange( Localize( "#player_resting" ), "steam_flag", /* don't show filter */nullptr, 15, /* start now */0, 10 );
	//   SteamTimeline()->AddTaggedTimeRange( Localize( "#player_cast_light" ), "steam_starburst", Localize( "#player_spells" ), 10, /* start 10 sec ago */ -10, 5 );
	//
	// Adding a marker and time range in one event:
	//   TimelineEventHandle_t event = SteamTimeline()->StartEvent( /* start now */ 0 );
	//   SteamTimeline()->ShowEventOnTimeline( event, "steam_heart", Localize( "#player_healed" ), Localize( "#player_healed_amount", 27 ), 15 );
	//   SteamTimeline()->AddEventTag( event, Localize( "#player_cast_heal" ), "steam_heart", Localize( "#player_, 15, /* start now */0, 10 );
	//   ... // time passes
	//   SteamTimeline()->CloseEvent( event );
	//
	// Parameters used by the event functions:
	//
	// - ulOpenEvent: An event returned by StartEvent that has not yet had CancelEvent or CloseEvent called on it
	// - ulEvent: An event that has had CloseEvent called on it, or an event returned from AddSimpleTimelineEvent or AddTaggedTimeRange (which
	//   are closed automatically.)
	// - pchIcon: specify the name of the icon uploaded through the Steamworks Partner Site for your title
	//   or one of the provided icons that start with steam_
	// - pchTitle & pchDescription: provide a localized string in the language returned by
	//	 SteamUtils()->GetSteamUILanguage()
	// - unIconPriority: specify how important this range is compared to other markers provided by the game.
	//   Ranges with larger priority values will be displayed more prominently in the UI. This value
	//   may be between 0 and k_unMaxTimelinePriority.
	// - flStartOffsetSeconds: The time that this range started relative to now. Negative times
	//   indicate an event that happened in the past.
	// - flDurationSeconds: How long the time range should be in seconds. For instantaneous events, this
	//   should be 0
	// - ePossibleClip: By setting this parameter to Featured or Standard, the game indicates to Steam that it
	//   would be appropriate to offer this range as a clip to the user. For instantaneous events, the
	//   suggested clip will be for a short time before and after the event itself.
	// - pchTagIcon: specify an icon name that will be used next to the tag name in the UI
	// - pchTagName: The localized name of the tag to show in the UI.
	// - pchTagGroup: The localized name of the tag group to show in the UI. If this is not specified, users will not be able to filter by this tag
	// - unTagPriority: specify how important this tag is compared to other tags provided by the game.
	// Returns:
	//   A TimelineEventHandle_t that can be used to make subsequent calls to refer to the timeline event. This event handle is invalid
	//   after the game exits.

	/*******************    Game Phases    *******************/

	// Game phases allow the user to navigate their background recordings and clips. Exactly what a game phase means will vary game to game, but
	// the game phase should be a section of gameplay that is usually between 10 minutes and a few hours in length, and should be the
	// main way a user would think to divide up the game. These are presented to the user in a UI that shows the date the game was played,
	// with one row per game slice. Game phases should be used to mark sections of gameplay that the user might be interested in watching.
	//
	//	Examples could include:
	//		* A single match in a multiplayer PvP game
	//		* A chapter of a story-based singleplayer game
	//		* A single run in a roguelike
	//
	// Game phases are started with StartGamePhase, and while a phase is still happening, they can have tags and attributes added to them.
	//
	// Phase attributes represent generic text fields that can be updated throughout the duration of the phase. They are meant
	// to be used for phase metadata that is not part of a well defined set of options. For example, a KDA attribute that starts
	// with the value "0/0/0" and updates as the phase progresses, or something like a played-entered character name. Attributes
	// can be set as many times as the game likes with SetGamePhaseAttribute, and only the last value will be shown to the user.
	//
	// Phase tags represent data with a well defined set of options, which could be data such as match resolution, hero played,
	// game mode, etc. Tags can have an icon in addition to a text name. Multiple tags within the same group may be added per phase
	// and all will be remembered. For example, AddGamePhaseTag may be called multiple times for a "Bosses Defeated" group, with
	// different names and icons for each boss defeated during the phase, all of which will be shown to the user.
	//
	// The phase will continue until the game exits, until the game calls EndGamePhase, or until the game calls
	// StartGamePhase to start a new phase.
	//
	// The game phase functions take these parameters:
	// - pchTagIcon: The name of a game provided timeline icon or builtin "steam_" icon.
	// - pchPhaseID: A game-provided persistent ID for a game phase. This could be a the match ID in a multiplayer game, a chapter name in a
	//   single player game, the ID of a character, etc.
	// - pchTagName: The localized name of the tag in the language returned by SteamUtils()->GetSteamUILanguage().
	// - pchTagGroup: The localized name of the tag group.
	// - pchAttributeValue: The localized name of the attribute.
	// - pchAttributeGroup: The localized name of the attribute group.
	// - unPriority: Used to order tags and attributes in the UI displayed to the user, with higher priority values leading
	//   to more prominent positioning. In contexts where there is limited space, lower priority items may be hidden.
