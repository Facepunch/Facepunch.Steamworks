	/// this to initialize the relay network or check if that initialization
	/// has completed.  If you do not call this, the initialization will
	/// happen the first time you use a feature that requires access to the
	/// relay network, and that use will be delayed.
	///
	/// Returns true if initialization has completed successfully.
	/// (It will probably return false on the first call.)
	///
	/// Typically initialization completes in a few seconds.
	///
	/// Note: dedicated servers hosted with Valve do *not* need to call
	/// this, since they do not make routing decisions.  However, if the
	/// dedicated server will be using P2P functionality, it will act as
	/// a "client" and this should be called.

	// "Ping location" functions
	//
	// We use the ping times to the valve relays deployed worldwide to
	// generate a "marker" that describes the location of an Internet host.
	// Given two such markers, we can estimate the network latency between
	// two hosts, without sending any packets.  The estimate is based on the
	// optimal route that is found through the Valve network.  If you are
	// using the Valve network to carry the traffic, then this is precisely
	// the ping you want.  If you are not, then the ping time will probably
	// still be a reasonable estimate.
	//
	// This is extremely useful to select peers for matchmaking!
	//
	// The markers can also be converted to a string, so they can be transmitted.
	// We have a separate library you can use on your backend to manipulate
	// these objects.  (See steamdatagram_ticketgen.h)

	/// Return location info for the current host.  Returns the approximate
	/// age of the data, in seconds, or -1 if no data is available.
	///
	/// It takes a few seconds to initialize access to the relay network.  If
	/// you call this very soon after calling InitializeRelayNetworkAccess,

	/// will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
	/// be actually used.
	///
	/// If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the route
	/// will be different, and the ping time might be better.  Or it might actually
	/// be a bit worse!  Standard IP routing is frequently suboptimal!
