## Why

The Steamworks C# implementations I found that were compatible with Unity have worked for a long time. But I hate them all. For a number of different reasons.

* They're not C#, they're just a collection of functions.
* They're not up to date.
* They require a 3rd party native dll.
* They can't be compiled into a standalone dll (in Unity).
* They're not free
* They have a restrictive license.

C# is meant to make things easier. So lets try to wrap it up in a way that makes it all easier.

## What

### Get your own information

```csharp
    SteamClient.SteamId // Your SteamId
    SteamClient.Name // Your Name
```

### View your friends list

```csharp
foreach ( var friend in SteamFriends.GetFriends() )
{
    Console.WriteLine( "{friend.Id}: {friend.Name}" );
    Console.WriteLine( "{friend.IsOnline} / {friend.SteamLevel}" );
    
    friend.SendMessage( "Hello Friend" );
}
```


### App Info

```csharp
    Console.WriteLine( SteamApps.GameLanguage ); // Print the current game language
    var installDir = SteamApps.AppInstallDir( 4000 ); // Get the path to the Garry's Mod install folder

    var fileinfo = await SteamApps.GetFileDetailsAsync( "hl2.exe" ); // async get file details
    DoSomething( fileinfo.SizeInBytes, fileinfo.Sha1 );
```

### Get Avatars

```csharp
    var image = await SteamFriends.GetLargeAvatarAsync( steamid );
    if ( !image.HasValue ) return DefaultImage;

    return MakeTextureFromRGBA( image.Value.Data, image.Value.Width, image.Value.Height );
```

### Get a list of servers

```csharp
using ( var list = new ServerList.Internet() )
{
    list.AddFilter( "map", "de_dust" );
    await list.RunQueryAsync();

    foreach ( var server in list.Responsive )
    {
        Console.WriteLine( $"{server.Address} {server.Name}" );
    }
}
```

### Achievements

List them

```csharp
    foreach ( var a in SteamUserStats.Achievements )
    {
        Console.WriteLine( $"{a.Name} ({a.State}})" );
    }	
```

Unlock them

```csharp
    var ach = new Achievement( "GM_PLAYED_WITH_GARRY" );
    ach.Trigger();
```

### Voice

```csharp
    SteamUser.VoiceRecord = KeyDown( "V" );

    if ( SteamUser.HasVoiceData )
    {
        var bytesrwritten = SteamUser.ReadVoiceData( stream );
        // Send Stream Data To Server or Something
    }
```


### Auth

```csharp
    // Client sends ticket data to server somehow
    var ticket = SteamUser.GetAuthSessionTicket();

    // server listens to event
    SteamServer.OnValidateAuthTicketResponse += ( steamid, ownerid, rsponse ) =>
    {
        if ( rsponse == AuthResponse.OK )
            TellUserTheyCanBeOnServer( steamid );
        else
            KickUser( steamid );
    };

    // server gets ticket data from client, calls this function.. which either returns
    // false straight away, or will issue a TicketResponse.
    if ( !SteamServer.BeginAuthSession( ticketData, clientSteamId ) )
    {
        KickUser( clientSteamId );
    }

    //
    // Client is leaving, cancels their ticket OnValidateAuth is called on the server again
    // this time with AuthResponse.AuthTicketCanceled
    //
    ticket.Cancel();
```

### Utils

```csharp
    SteamUtils.SecondsSinceAppActive;
    SteamUtils.SecondsSinceComputerActive;
    SteamUtils.IpCountry;
    SteamUtils.UsingBatteryPower;
    SteamUtils.CurrentBatteryPower;
    SteamUtils.AppId;
    SteamUtils.IsOverlayEnabled;
    SteamUtils.IsSteamRunningInVR;
    SteamUtils.IsSteamInBigPictureMode;
```

### Workshop

Download a workshop item by ID

```csharp

Get a workshop item information

```csharp
    var itemInfo = await Ugc.Item.Get( 1720164672 );

    Console.WriteLine( $"Title: {itemInfo?.Title}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"IsInstalled: {itemInfo?.IsInstalled}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"IsDownloading: {itemInfo?.IsDownloading}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"IsDownloadPending: {itemInfo?.IsDownloadPending}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"IsSubscribed: {itemInfo?.IsSubscribed}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"NeedsUpdate: {itemInfo?.NeedsUpdate}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"Description: {itemInfo?.Description}" );
```

Query a list of workshop items

```csharp
    var q = Ugc.Query.All
                    .WithTag( "Fun" )
                    .WithTag( "Movie" )
                    .MatchAllTags();

    var result = await q.GetPageAsync( 1 );

    Console.WriteLine( $"ResultCount: {result?.ResultCount}" );
    Console.WriteLine( $"TotalCount: {result?.TotalCount}" );

    foreach ( Ugc.Item entry in result.Value.Entries )
    {
        Console.WriteLine( $" {entry.Title}" );
    }
```

Query items created by friends

```csharp
    var q = Ugc.UserQuery.All
                        .CreatedByFriends();
```

Query items created by yourself

                      .WithContent( "c:/folder/addon/location" )
                      .WithTag( "awesome" )
                      .WithTag( "small" )

    }
```

Get a list of your items

```csharp
    var result = await SteamInventory.GetItems();

    // result is disposable, good manners to dispose after use
    using ( result )

        foreach ( InventoryItem item in items )
        {

# Getting Started

## Client

To initialize a client you can do this.

```csharp
using Steamworks;

// ...

try 
{
    SteamClient.Init( 4000 );
}
catch ( System.Exception e )
{
    // Couldn't init for some reason (steam is closed etc)
}
```

Replace 4000 with the appid of your game. You shouldn't call any Steam functions before you initialize.

When you're done, when you're closing your game, just shutdown.

```csharp
SteamClient.Shutdown();
```

## Server

To create a server do this.

```csharp
var serverInit = new SteamServerInit( "gmod", "Garry Mode" )
{
    GamePort = 28015,
    Secure = true,
    QueryPort = 28016
};

try
{
    Steamworks.SteamServer.Init( 4000, serverInit );
}
catch ( System.Exception )
{
    // Couldn't init for some reason (dll errors, blocked ports)
}
```
